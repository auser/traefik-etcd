I'm building a frontend for editing Traefik configs from the rust config. 

I'm using SvelteKit and the config is stored in a MySQL database inside the rust store.

Can you help me build and extend the frontend so that new traefik configurations can be created, edited, and deleted?

I've already built the backend and have a MySQL database with a table for configs.

I'm also using a Rust backend with a SvelteKit frontend.

I want to add the ability to create, edit, and delete traefik configurations.

Can you help me build and extend the frontend so that new traefik configurations can be created, edited, and deleted?

In addition, I want to be able to autosave when editing a configuration as well as be able to load a previous configuration. I also want to be able to submit a post request to the backend to save the configuration.

Can you help me build and extend the frontend so that new traefik configurations can be created, edited, and deleted?
